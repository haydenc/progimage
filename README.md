# progimage
Python-based API for image transformation

## Links
[iOS Shim](https://github.com/haydenc/progimage-ios)

## Notes
* Only a few tests, to provide a sample
* The `get_mimetype` method is horrible, but the alternative is lengthy, omitted for brevity
* Implemented as a Django project, lots of boilerplate - the interesting bits are:
** library/viewsets.py
** library/transformers.py
